Monty Hall hosted the gameshow “Let's Make a Deal.” Contestents chose to open random doors to win thousands of dollars, new cars, or, hilariously, farm animals. 
 
The concept was borrowed for a controversial statistical puzzle, although Monty Hall insists his gameshow never had an event with this interesting kink. Monty Hall presents three doors, one concealing a car, the other two concealing goats. (You want the car.) After you pick a door (say, door 1) Monty Hall opens a different door (say, door 2) to show a goat. Then Monty Hall asks, would you like to stay with your choice of door (door 1) or would you like to swap to the remaining door (door 3)? 
 
The intuitive answer is this choice shouldn’t matter. With two doors, one car, and one goat, there should be a 50% chance of winning the car whether the contestant swaps or stays. However, this is not the case: because there was a ⅔ chance the first choice of door conceals a goat, there is a ⅔ chance the remaining door conceals the car.
